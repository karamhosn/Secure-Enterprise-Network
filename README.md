## Introduction

This repository contains all of the files and documentation for the design and implementation of a secure enterprise network. 

Under the `docs/` folder, you will find a `.pdf` file containing the project description and an overview of the features implemented for this meticulously planned system. You will also find another `.pdf` file containing addressing tables for this particular network design.

## How To Open The Project

Under the `packet.tracer/` folder, find and download the `.pkt` file and open it using Cisco Packet Tracer version 9.0.0.

## Configuration and Verification Files

Under the `configs/` folder, you will find a `.txt` file where I have included some configuration and verification IOS commands specific to each step taken to during the project implementation. 

Note that all devices in the `.pkt` file are *already* configured properly. The inclusion of configuration details is *strictly* for documentation purposes, as some key configurations for re-implementation are purposely not included. 

## Network Topology

Under the `images/` folder, you will find a `.png` file containing the network topology diagram.
